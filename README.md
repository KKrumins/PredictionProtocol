# PredictionProtocol

Wireless sensor network routing protocol that predicts the delivery of the message to a particular node and uses the day, time period, and this predicted value for routing choices. This is a part of masters' thesis project.

Protocol is built in OMNeT++ 5.7 simulator and uses INET framework (can be avoided by deleting it form Network.ned).  

In order to run it, you need to install OMNeT++ 5.7. Then import the project into your workspace and fix references if necessery.
